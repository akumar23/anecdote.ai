# Anecdote AI

Home page for Anecdote AI to describe what the company does and house the chat interface once its built.

The standard next.js stack but just with typescript and tailwind. Pretty much entirely a frontend project.

With evovle to include nextAuth to handle user's signing in so their chat sessions don't get mixed up.
